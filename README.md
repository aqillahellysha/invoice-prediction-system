# 🧾 Invoice Processing Time Prediction System

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements an **Agile Machine Learning pipeline** to predict the time required to process financial invoices. It addresses the business problem of **resource allocation** by allowing Team Leads to estimate workload and Managers to monitor team efficiency.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Model v1 (Baseline):** Linear Regression using only `Invoice Amount`.
* **Model v2 (Production):** Random Forest Regressor using `User Name`, `Document Type`, and `Amount`.
* **Predictive App:** Streamlit interface for real-time estimations.
* **Monitoring Dashboard:** Tracks model accuracy, latency, and user feedback.
